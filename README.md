Bug Free Adventure v.0.0.1 (Pre-Alpha)
=================
This is a repository with classes useful for Android developers. Created for personal use.

Consists of:
1. Parent activity and fragment classes with several methods for logs and system toasts, which can be disabled on production.
2. Static methods for getting width, height, diagonal length, API version, device name, device id of the device.
3. Static methods for quick string formating, md5 hash and other.

I plan that this mini-library wil be not big and massive but at the same time very useful.

It`s library better for others because its mine. So use it as is.
