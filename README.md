Bug Free Adventure Tool v.0.0.1 (Pre-Alpha)
=================
This is a repository with classes useful for Android developers. Created for personal use.

Consists of:
 - Parent activity and fragment classes with several methods for logs and system toasts, which can be disabled on production.
 - Static methods for getting width, height, diagonal length, API version, name, id of the device.
 - Static methods for quick string formating, md5 hash and other.

I plan this library to be small but useful.

It`s library better for others because its mine. So use it as is.
